Sublimelinting Works! Syntax file is just started. Note this only works with https://github.com/rakitzis/rc, because you can invoke it with the `-n flag`

# rc-shell-linter-for-Sublimetext3
Sublimelinter3 plugin for rc shell https://github.com/rakitzis/rc

The syntax files is copied from https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck and mostly commented out
The sublimelinter3 file is copied from the sublimelinter3 repository: https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3
I think already in this state it might be useful, because this sublimelinter3 plugin immediately tells you if you made simple synatx mistakes. If you don't need syntax highlighting this is already useful and it's just about 10 lines of python code plus the shell itself needs very little resources.
If you want to improve this or upload it to packagecontrol.io or integrate it to shellcheck.net or your project that would be great.
